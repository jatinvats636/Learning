                    Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or
                    eggs,
                    and
                    formed into
                    sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or
                    lentils,
                    are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste
                    and texture, or as a gluten-free alternative. Pasta is a staple food of Italian cuisine.Pasta is a
